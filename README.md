# heimdall
Comparable with fail2ban but based on Rust and optimized for high performance. Log scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/access_log) and bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password failures, seeking for exploits, etc.

We will test it for our usecase and see if this really works
